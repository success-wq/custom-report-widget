## Future Webhook Integration

To automatically send data from GHL to your sheet:

1. In your Apps Script, the `doPost()` function is ready to receive webhook data
2. Set up a GHL workflow to trigger on opportunity events
3. Configure webhook to POST to your Apps Script URL with this format:

```json
{
  "rowData": {
    "First Name": "John",
    "Last Name": "Doe",
    "Contracted Date": "2024-01-15",
    "Total Sold Price": "50000",
    ...
  }
}
```
